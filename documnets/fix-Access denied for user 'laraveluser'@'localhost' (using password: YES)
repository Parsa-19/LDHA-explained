mysql version on db container = mysql8.0
you need to first have the data base named 'laravel_db' in db container. create if you do not have.


- enter db container:
	>>> docker compose exec -it bd bash
- enter mysql:
	>>> mysql
- create new user with password:
	(mysql)> CREATE USER 'laraveluser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'db123';
- Grant privileges on user:
	(mysql)> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'laraveluser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
- flush:
	(mysql)> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


then edit docker-compose.yml file.
change environment variables under db container:
...
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: laravel_db
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: db123
#      MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: true
      SERVICE_TAGS: dev
      SERVICE_NAME: mysql
...
save and quit

then change .env file to set new databse information:
...
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel_db
DB_USERNAME=laraveluser
DB_PASSWORD="db123"
...
save and quit


run docker compose up -d to let docker compose recreate db container.
	>>> docker compose up -d

run these commands (if there was error randomly run them to solve :)))) :

>>> docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
>>> docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
>>> docker compose exec app php artisan cache:clear
>>> docker compose exec app php artisan config:cache
then:
>>> docker compose up -d




go to browser check localhost to see if the error "Access denied for user 'laraveluser'@'localhost' (using password: YES)" is solved or not.
