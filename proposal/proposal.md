# Definition & The General Idea
Im going to load-balance two applications(Laravel and Django) by HAproxy on Ubuntu. <br>
HAproxy will serve two web apps Django/Laravel depend on request it gets from browser. <br>
Each phase is going to be implemented in docker and will have a docker compose file for itself. <br>
docker compose files are for: Django, Laravel, Haproxy <br>



# 1- config HAproxy and create a docker compose file for it
explain the phase and make a list and set the time

# 2- set up Laravel app on 3 contrainers
explain the phase and make a list and set the time

# 3- set up Django app and its containers
explain the phase and make a list and set the time
