# Definition & The General Idea
Im going to load-balance two applications(Laravel and Django) by HAproxy on Ubuntu. <br>
HAproxy will serve weather Django or Laravel depends on the request it gets from browser. <br>
Each phase is going to be implemented in docker and will have a docker compose file for itself. <br>
A yml file for HAproxy container, another one for Laravel containers and one more for Django. <br>


# 1- config HAproxy and create a docker compose file for it
explain the phase and make a list and set the time

# 2- set up Laravel app on 3 contrainers
explain the phase and make a list and set the time

# 3- set up Django app and its containers
explain the phase and make a list and set the time
