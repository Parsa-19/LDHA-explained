# Definition Of The General Idea
Im going to load-balance two applications(Laravel and Django) by HAproxy on a Ubuntu. <br>
HAproxy will serve weather Django or Laravel by the request it gets from browser. <br>
Each phase is going to be implemented in docker and will have a docker compose file for itself:  <br>
a yml file for HAproxy container, another one for Laravel containers and one more for Django. <br>


# 1- config HAproxy and create a docker compose file for it

# 2- set up Laravel app 

# 3- set up Django app

phase 1: explain the phase and make a list and set the time
phase 2: explain the phase and make a list and set the time
phase 3: explain the phase and make a list and set the time
